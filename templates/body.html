        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
            <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

                <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
                <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
